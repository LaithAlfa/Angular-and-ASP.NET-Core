        Hello There!
        <br /><br />
        This is a test to see if the StaticFiles middleware is working Properly 
        <br /><br />
        What about the client-side cache? Does it work or not?
        <br /><br />
        it seems like we can configure it: we disables it during devellopment, and enableed it in production!
